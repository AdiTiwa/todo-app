# Day 2
Its day 2, and I thought this might be fun, just to plan out later additions and see what I have done in the past day. Today was mainly about css, and styling, even if I wanted to add Firebase and authentication today. I have decided to try and learn [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as a css framework for this app in particular. I would say its a really nice framework, though the importing, on my machine in particular, took a rather long time. It did make a few things easier, like making columns appear a lot easier than writing css on my own. 
On top of that, at the end of yesterday I had a *functioning* product. It existed, but you couldn't see any of the To-Do items that you had. So the first order of business today was to obviously to fix it, and I think I got it functioning. I used a standard css stylesheet, again by Tania Rascia, which helped a lot. However, going to look forward to Bulma working so I can add some more personalized graphics.
